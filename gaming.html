                I'm an avid gamer, with a particular preference for story-drive action-adventure games. I'm beyond excited for the next God of War game in November!
                Some of my other favorite modern franchises include The Last of Us, Horizon: Zero Dawn and Forbidden West, and the new Tomb Raider games.  As for
                classic games, I first cut my teeth on NES games like Battletoads, Super Mario Bros, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SIHdrQ8oWI">Millipede</a>,
                and Megaman.  As I got older, I fell in love with classics like Myst, Crash Bandicoot, Medievil, Oddworld, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, and Heart of
                Darkness - an exceptionally gruesome game for which I have <i>no earthly idea</i> how it got an E rating, as it gave poor 7-year-old me nightmares for
                YEARS. 😅

                Decades later, I still hold a fondness for video games, and while it's hard to find the time to play as much as I used to, I still find time to enjoy
                both new and classic games.  As my 4 year old daughter gets older, I love that I can start playing kid-friendly games with her like Mario Kart, Mario
                Party, Kirby, and Minecraft.  And if I ever manage to find a moment of free time, it's always fun to kick back to play a little ARK: Survival Evolved
                or Civilization VI.
