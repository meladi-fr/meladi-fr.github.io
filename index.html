                <h4>Describe how you plan to build upon your webpage.</h4>
                <p>I don't quite have a direction for what I want my webpage to be about beyond the course assignments, but I have some ideas for how I want to implement it.  
                I plan to utilize PHP elements to standardize the visual elements across the pages (header, footer, menu, etc), and will use Bootstrap as my CSS framework 
                since I really love the way it looks (please let me know if none of this is allowed for the course). </p>
                <h4>Why did you select the site that you chose? </h4>
                <p>I chose github, mainly because I already have a github account that I've played around with for some other small projects - though my favorite version 
                control software is still Team Foundation Server (now Azure DevOps).  </p>
                <h4>Describe how you plan to build upon your webpage in your next step(s). </h4>
                <p>For the first couple weeks it will just be for hosting the weekly assignments per specification, but as we build toward the mastery assignment I'll be 
                building it up and adding additional pages, adding my own personal flair. </p>
