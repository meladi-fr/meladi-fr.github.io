                    Among my many hobbies is a love for hunting for wild edible plants and fungi.  Mushrooms are especially fun to hunt for, but I'm overly cautious with which ones I harvest.  I mostly stick to the easiest ones to identify, such as puffballs (which are in my foraging document) and morels.  It's important to never eat mushrooms with both white caps <i>and</i> white gills - most of them are deadly poisonous!  There are some that are edible, but I'm not nearly confident enough in my ID'ing skills to try my luck.  Most mushrooms with white caps and pink gills are very tasty, being closely related to portobello mushrooms... but there is one exception that commonly grows where I am: the Yellow Stainer.<br /><br />
                    Unfortunately, I learned how to identify this one the hard way!  My mistake in thinking this was a field mushroom,  was from cutting it too high up the base, instead of slicing it directly at ground level.  Thankfully this isn't a deadly mushroom, it just gives quite a nasty bellyache.  The only reason I even attempted to eat this mushroom is because I knew there were no deadly lookalikes, but it wasn't a fun day.  Lesson learned!

                    While my vegetable garden is all but a lost cause in my drought-stricked state of Utah, there are so many delicious and useful things that grow natively.
                    Over the years I've compiled a small list of plants that can be foraged both in my yard and around the area I live - though it's certainly not a complete list!  I haven't had a chance to go out and forage recently, so there's still much more to add - wild onion, alfalfa, salsify, mullein, curly dock, there's so much more I need to document! What's more, I plan to move to Western Washington at some point in the coming years, so I'll have a wonderful opportunity to start a new volume of native forage identification.  You can read through my little compendium below.
